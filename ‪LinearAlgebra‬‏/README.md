# NumPy Array Manipulation Project

This project demonstrates various array manipulation techniques using NumPy. It involves creating arrays, accessing elements, reshaping arrays, and performing basic slicing operations on a 3x3 matrix.

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have Python and NumPy installed. You can install NumPy using:
```bash
pip install numpy
```

## Project Overview

The project demonstrates the following tasks:

1. **Array Creation**: Creates a 3x3 NumPy array.
2. **Array Properties**: Checks and displays the shape of the array.
3. **Element Access**:
   - Selects the first row.
   - Selects the second column.
   - Accesses a specific element (second element in the third column).
4. **Array Slicing**: Creates a 2x2 sub-array from the first two rows and columns.
5. **Array Reshaping**:
   - Creates a single row vector from the original array.
   - Creates a single column vector from the original array.

## Usage

To execute the code:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/numpy-array-manipulation.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd numpy-array-manipulation
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python numpy_array_manipulation.py
   ```

The script will output the following:
- Shape of the original 3x3 array.
- The first row and second column of the array.
- The second element from the third column.
- A 2x2 sub-array from the original array.
- A flattened version of the array as a single row vector.
- A flattened version of the array as a single column vector.

## Features

1. **Array Creation**: Easily create NumPy arrays with custom data.
2. **Array Access**: Retrieve specific rows, columns, or individual elements.
3. **Slicing and Reshaping**: Perform common operations like slicing sub-arrays and reshaping arrays into different forms.
4. **Output Information**: Displays array properties and results of manipulations.
