## Project Overview

Diabetes is a chronic medical condition that affects how your body turns food into energy. The project aims to create models that can predict whether a person is likely to develop diabetes based on certain health metrics. Accurate predictions can help in early detection and management, ultimately improving patient outcomes. 

### Objectives
- Analyze the dataset for patterns and correlations related to diabetes.
- Build and evaluate multiple machine learning models to find the most effective approach for diabetes prediction.
- Visualize the data to provide insights into factors affecting diabetes risk.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database). This dataset contains a total of 768 entries and features the following columns:

- `Pregnancies`: Number of times pregnant
- `Glucose`: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- `BloodPressure`: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- `SkinThickness`: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- `Insulin`: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- `BMI`: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- `DiabetesPedigreeFunction`: A function that scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history
- `Age`: Age (years)
- `Outcome`: Class variable (0 or 1) where 1 indicates diabetes and 0 indicates no diabetes

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis
- `numpy`: For numerical operations
- `matplotlib`: For data visualization
- `seaborn`: For enhanced data visualization
- `scikit-learn`: For implementing machine learning algorithms
- `tensorflow`: For building and training the neural network model

## Installation

You can install the required packages using pip. To set up your environment, follow these steps:

1. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv diabetes_env
   source diabetes_env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `diabetes_env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow
   ```

## Usage

To run the project, execute the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python diabetes_prediction.py
```

Ensure that the Python script name matches your file. This script will perform data loading, preprocessing, exploratory analysis, modeling, and evaluation.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In the EDA phase, we conduct the following analyses:

- **Data Cleaning**: Check for missing values and outliers.
- **Distribution Analysis**: Analyze the distribution of the `Outcome` variable to understand the prevalence of diabetes in the dataset.
- **Correlation Matrix**: Create a heatmap to visualize correlations between different features, which helps identify the most significant predictors of diabetes.
- **Feature Visualization**: Use box plots and histograms to visualize the distribution of key features such as `Glucose`, `BMI`, and `Age`.

## Modeling Techniques

### 1. Linear Regression
   - A basic regression model that predicts the outcome using a linear relationship.
   - Suitable for understanding the influence of individual features on diabetes risk.

### 2. Random Forest Regressor
   - An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting.
   - Handles non-linear relationships effectively and provides feature importance metrics.

### 3. Neural Network
   - A deep learning model designed to capture complex patterns in the data.
   - Comprises multiple layers of neurons, allowing it to learn intricate relationships between input features and the output.

## Results

The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
- **R-squared (RÂ²)**: Indicates the proportion of variance in the outcome variable explained by the model.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visual representation of the classification performance, showing true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative counts.
- **Classification Report**: Detailed report including precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.

Visualizations of the results are included to provide insights into the model performance and areas for improvement.

## Future Improvements

- **Feature Engineering**: Explore additional features that could enhance prediction accuracy.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Implement techniques such as Grid Search or Random Search to find optimal parameters for models.
- **Cross-Validation**: Use k-fold cross-validation to ensure model robustness and generalizability.
- **Deployment**: Create a web application to allow users to input their data and receive diabetes risk predictions.
