# Diabetes Prediction

This project aims to develop a predictive model for diabetes outcomes using various machine learning techniques. By analyzing medical data, the project seeks to identify key factors that contribute to diabetes and predict whether a patient is likely to develop the condition. The project incorporates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the implementation of multiple machine learning models, including Neural Networks.

## Project Overview

Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs when the body cannot effectively process glucose, leading to high blood sugar levels. Early detection and intervention are crucial for managing diabetes and preventing complications. This project utilizes a dataset containing various health indicators to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on their medical history and physical attributes.

### Objectives

1. **Data Analysis**: To understand the characteristics of the dataset and the relationships between features.
2. **Feature Selection**: To identify the most significant features that contribute to diabetes prediction.
3. **Model Development**: To create and evaluate different machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks, for accurate diabetes prediction.
4. **Visualization**: To provide insights through visualizations that represent the data distribution and model performance.
5. **Performance Evaluation**: To assess the effectiveness of the models using appropriate metrics and improve their accuracy.

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have Python installed, along with the following libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow` (for Keras)

You can install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow
```

## Data Description

The project uses a dataset named `diabetes.csv`, which contains various medical features for patients, with the following columns:
- **Pregnancies**: Number of times pregnant.
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.
- **BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
- **SkinThickness**: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm).
- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
- **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: A function which scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history.
- **Age**: Age (years).
- **Outcome**: Class variable (0 or 1) indicating whether the patient has diabetes.

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Handle missing values by replacing zero values with the median of their respective columns.
   - Encode categorical variables if needed (not applicable in this dataset).
   - Perform exploratory data analysis to visualize distributions and correlations.

2. **Machine Learning Models**:
   - Multiple models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) are trained to predict diabetes outcomes.
   - A Neural Network model is also built using TensorFlow/Keras, featuring several hidden layers and activation functions.
   - The data is split into training and testing sets (e.g., 70% training, 30% testing).
   - Model performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and classification report.

### Running the Code

To execute the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd diabetes-prediction
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python diabetes_prediction.py
   ```

Make sure to update the file path to match the location of your `diabetes.csv` file.

## Features

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values and prepares the dataset for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualizes data distributions and relationships using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
3. **Multiple Machine Learning Models**: Trains different models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict diabetes.
4. **Neural Network Classification**: Implements a Neural Network model for classification using TensorFlow/Keras.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates models using accuracy, MSE, and classification report.

## Model Development

- **Logistic Regression**: A statistical method used for binary classification that estimates the probability of a binary response based on one or more predictor variables.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees and merges them together to get a more accurate and stable prediction.
- **Neural Network**: A deep learning approach that mimics the way the human brain operates. This model consists of input, hidden, and output layers, allowing it to learn complex patterns from the data.

## Results

The project includes visualizations and metrics that demonstrate the performance of each model. The results section will detail:
- Accuracy of each model.
- Confusion matrix and classification reports.
- ROC curve and AUC score for model evaluation.
