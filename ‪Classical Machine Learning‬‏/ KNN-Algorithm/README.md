1. **Data Loading**:
   - Uses the `load_diabetes` dataset from `sklearn`, which contains data about diabetes progression based on various health factors.

2. **Data Splitting**:
   - Splits the dataset into features (`X`) and target (`y`), then further divides it into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using `train_test_split`.

3. **Feature Scaling**:
   - Standardizes the features using `StandardScaler` to improve model performance, as KNN is sensitive to the scale of the features.

4. **Polynomial Feature Expansion**:
   - Generates polynomial features of degree 2 to capture non-linear relationships.

5. **K-Nearest Neighbors Regression**:
   - Creates and trains a KNN regression model with 5 neighbors (`n_neighbors=5`), which predicts based on the average of the nearest 5 neighbors.

6. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Uses `Mean Squared Error (MSE)` and `R² Score` to assess the model’s performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement:
1. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Try different values of `n_neighbors` to find the optimal number that gives the best performance. You can use `GridSearchCV` or manually iterate over a range of values.

2. **Cross-Validation**:
   - Implement cross-validation to get a more reliable measure of the model's performance.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Similar to previous examples, plot the predicted vs. true values and the residuals for better insight into the model’s predictions.

4. **Experiment with Different Degrees**:
   - Test different polynomial degrees to see how they affect the model's ability to fit the data.

Here’s how you can add the visualization:

```python
# Plot True vs Predicted values
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
plt.scatter(y_test, y_pred, color='blue', edgecolor='k', alpha=0.7)
plt.plot([y_test.min(), y_test.max()], [y_test.min(), y_test.max()], 'k--', lw=2)
plt.xlabel('True Values')
plt.ylabel('Predicted Values')
plt.title('True vs Predicted Values for KNN Regression')
plt.show()

# Plot Residuals
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
residuals = y_test - y_pred
plt.scatter(y_pred, residuals, color='red', edgecolor='k', alpha=0.7)
plt.hlines(0, y_pred.min(), y_pred.max(), colors='black', linestyles='dashed')
plt.xlabel('Predicted Values')
plt.ylabel('Residuals')
plt.title('Residuals Plot for KNN Regression')
plt.show()
```
